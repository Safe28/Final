    <p id="pa">This program is especially for preschool groups with students ages 3â€“5.
        The program introduces the Museum and art concepts to young children
        through developmentally appropriate activities. During the 1 1/2-hour
        program, students have a picture book read to them in the </p>
    <p id="r">galleries, explore works of art that relate to the book, and
        make an art project to take home. Visiting schools receive
        preparatory materials, including the selected picture book to
        read to students and to become a permanent part of the school
        library. $100 per class. Class size is limited to twenty students.
        Groups with more than twenty students must register for two classes.
        Two classes can be accommodated on one day. Please bring one chaperone
        for every five students. Classes run from 10:00 to 11:30 a.m. Fee
        includes art materials and instructional hour. To register, call
        215-684-7580.</p>
